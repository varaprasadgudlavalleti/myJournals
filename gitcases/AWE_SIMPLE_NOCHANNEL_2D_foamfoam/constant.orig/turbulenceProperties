//RASModel â€“ buoyantKEpsilon:
//This specifies that the turbulence model being used is the buoyant k-epsilon model.
//This variant of the standard k-epsilon model includes modifications to account for buoyancy effects.
//Such effects are important in flows where density variations (often due to temperature or concentration differences) drive the motion.

//turbulence on:
//This flag explicitly turns on turbulence modeling.
//Even though the simulation type is set to laminar, this parameter instructs the solver to include turbulence effects via the chosen RAS model.

//printCoeffs on:
//This setting directs the solver to print the turbulence model coefficients during the simulation.
//This can be useful for debugging or verifying that the model parameters are correctly applied.



//Cg:
//This coefficient is specific to the buoyant k-epsilon model.
//It generally appears in the buoyancy production term of the turbulence kinetic energy equation.
//A value of 0.85 is within a typical range, but it may be adjusted based on experimental data or specific simulation requirements.
